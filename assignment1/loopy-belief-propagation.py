'''
 Implement loopy belief propagation decoding algorithm for LDPC code; use the ecient approach 
 described above to compute the messages from factors to variables; implement parallel and sequential 
 schedules and dampened updates. We will assess the eciency of your implementation during grading 
 (for example it is not recommended to use nested loops during one iteration of the decoder). 
 Make a picture which illustrates the decoding process (see Ô¨Åg. 1 for an example)
